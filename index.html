     <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
     <p>This may not sound like a lot of experience, but finishing my second year as a developer has been a huge milestone for me. This is because I had no real experience doing web development — and not much programming experience in general beyond some basic C# and Java training I got from a few online courses. I also didn’t have a computer science degree since I graduated with a degree in IT project management.I’d never written about my experience despite all the help I’ve received from wonderful resources like Medium, Stack Overflow, and Reddit’s programming subreddits. So today, I decided to change that. Today I’m going to fill you in on what went right, and what didn’t, so that if you’re embarking on this journey, you’ll have better luck than I did.</p>
     <h2>Work Experience</h2>
     <h4><table><th>Careere Objective:</th></table></h4>
     <p>To establish various website that are mostly helpful for the people.Also design the web site as well.My main goal is to prepare any website perfecty as client says.I don't spend much time anguishing over tech stack. Whatever tech stack provides the least resistance is the way I prefer to roll. On the front-end, for example, I've found it's been much, much easier to bang out products and features using AngularJS 1.5 than it was a few years back using BackboneJS and Marionette.</p>
